Been thinking about how exactly to implement PageRank.

A preliminary test showed that the Ruby Matrix class struggles on smallish machines with a square matrix with a few thousand rows.

So: do I break the problem into smaller matrices, use a different Matrix (custom?) class, get larger machines, or avoid an in-memory matrix all together?

I'm thinking I want to break the problem down into smaller matrices.  Ideally, the implementation should be able to adapt to whatever size machine it's on - taking advantage of the larger machine if it can etc.

## Distributed PageRank
### Basic Idea
We find a "starting" page, and fetch all backlinks recursively to some specified depth.  Keep a count of the total number of pages fetched, and keep below a specified threshold. This is our input page set, which we use to create a matrix and perform the algorithm.

Meanwhile, we can find a different starting page - of a certain 'distance' from the other starting page, and perform the same computation.  We can do this in parallel, taking the average of any page ranks calculated for a page in both.

The trick will be finding a way to deterministically run the algorithm on _all_ pages.  I'm sure this basic approach has been done many times before, and I'm sure there are many solutions to this problem.  I think I'll work on my own for a bit before doing more research.
